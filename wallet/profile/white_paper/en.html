<h1>Vavilon Network</h1>
<p>Vavilon Network is an innovative network where all transactions are free for users, and validators earn income from mining. This model aims to create a more accessible and environmentally friendly blockchain community.</p>

<h2>2. Key Principles</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Free Transactions</strong>: All transactions in the Vavilon Network are free for users, making the platform more accessible and attractive to a wide audience.</li>
  <li><strong>Mining Income</strong>: Validators earn income from mining, ensuring the stability and security of the network. This also incentivizes validators to work efficiently and maintain the network.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Key Network Metrics</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Performance</strong>: The network can process up to 10,000 transactions per second, making it one of the fastest blockchain networks on the market.</li>
  <li><strong>Energy Efficiency</strong>: The use of the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) algorithm allows the network to be energy-efficient and environmentally friendly.</li>
  <li><strong>Security</strong>: The network uses multiple transaction confirmations and complex cryptographic algorithms to ensure a high level of security.</li>
  <li><strong>Scalability</strong>: The network supports scalability through the use of sharding technology, allowing many transactions to be processed in parallel.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Validators and Their Role</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Validators</strong>: Validators are responsible for confirming transactions and creating new blocks. They earn income from mining and are incentivized to work efficiently.</li>
  <li><strong>Incentives</strong>: Validators receive incentives for their work, ensuring their interest in maintaining the stability and security of the network.</li>
</ul>
