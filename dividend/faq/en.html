<p><strong>1. What are cryptocurrency dividends?</strong></p>
<p>Dividends are a portion of profits or rewards that a project distributes to its token holders.</p>

<p><strong>2. How to receive dividends?</strong></p>
<p>To participate in the distribution, you need to prove ownership of a <strong>governance token</strong> and send it to a special contract during each epoch.</p>

<p><strong>3. What is an "epoch"?</strong></p>
<p>This is a fixed time period during which the blockchain accounts for token holders. Only those who sent tokens to the contract within this epoch will receive rewards.</p>

<p><strong>4. Where should tokens be to participate?</strong></p>
<p>They must be manually sent to the project's contract each time. Simply holding them in a wallet or on an exchange is not enough.</p>

<p><strong>5. How to prove participation in an epoch?</strong></p>
<p>You need to send tokens to the specified contract before the epoch ends. The blockchain will automatically record the transaction.</p>

<p><strong>6. When are dividends paid?</strong></p>
<p>Usually after each epoch ends, but exact timing depends on the project.</p>

<p><strong>7. Is anything required besides sending tokens?</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes it's necessary to:</p>
<p>- Confirm participation for each new epoch</p>
<p>- Keep tokens locked until the epoch ends</p>

<p><strong>8. How to check the dividend amount?</strong></p>
<p>It depends on:</p>
<p>- The number of tokens sent</p>
<p>- The total reward pool</p>

<p><strong>9. Where to track information?</strong></p>
<p>- Project's official website</p>
<p>- Smart contract</p>
<p>- Blockchain explorers</p>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> Participation must be confirmed every epoch! Simply holding tokens does not grant reward rights.</p>
